# tomatobase
get up offa that thang


- tomatobase is the seat cushion that tells you when to get off your can!
- it's built using the BBC microbit v2, adafruit pressure sensors, and rust.
- thanks to the [nrf-rs](https://github.com/nrf-rs) team for bringing up the board and to the [embedded rust](https://github.com/rust-embedded/book) community for the know-how!
